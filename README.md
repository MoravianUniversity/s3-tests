To get this to run locally:

	- You will need a file called API_KEY.txt in the same directory as save_data.py which contains only your API key.

	- In ~/.aws you will need a file called credentials which will contain the following:

[<CLIENT_NAME>]
aws_access_key_id = <ACCESS_KEY>
aws_secret_access_key = <SECRET_ACCESS_KEY>

- Replace all <> with appropriate information.
